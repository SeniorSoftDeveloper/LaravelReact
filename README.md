# LaravelReact
This is the web application that uses Laravel as backend and React as frontend.

# How to use
composer create-project laravel/laravel:8.x.x lara_react_auth --prefer-dist <br/>
In my experience, this help doesn't work with this above command. It is only right in theory. <br/>
But this project works well, so I suggest to downland and run on your local computer this project. <br/>
An error can occour if you follow the instructions for the confliction of Laravel version and React version. <br/>
